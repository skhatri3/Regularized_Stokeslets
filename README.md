Implementation of Method of Regularized Stokeslets in 2D and 3D in Matlab 
The examples and implementation here are based on these two papers:
(1) R. Cortez, The method of regularized stokeslets, SIAM J. Sci. Comput. 23(4), 1205-1225, 2001.
(2) R. Cortez, L. Fauci, and A. Medovikov, The method of regularized Stokeslets in three dimensions: Analysis, validation, and application to helical swimming, Phys. Fluids. 17, 031504, 2005.

To get started in 2D use the following files: 
2D/main_example1.m
2D/main_example4b.m
2D/main_example4b_velocitytoforce.m

To get started in 3D use the following files:
3D/main_example1.m
3D/main_example1_velocitytoforce.m
